This project analyzes a healthcare dataset, focusing on patient demographics, medical conditions, admission types, and billing details. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), it visualizes patterns in age, gender, common conditions, and billing trends to uncover insights into healthcare utilization. Visualizations highlight key trends and relationships, offering a clearer view of the data for future decision-making.
